1. calculate a matrix of feasible batches for one packing station (using weight constraint 18kg). Calculate time to complete batch for each packing station.
    -- a feasible batch respects cobot capacity
    -- METHOD:  getFeasibleBatches(self, packingStationID: int) -> dict[batchID, List[OrderID]]:
                return feasibleBatchesDict
    Considerations for batch time completion calculation:
        Walking speed to get to shelves (human) 1.3 m/s
        Picking time for each item 3.0 seconds
        More than one cobot could be waiting on the same picker (this assumption seems super hard. Maybe we make optional).
        Moving speed of cobot is 2.0 m/s
        We also need to calculate the optimal route for each batch (this assumption is also super hard. We might need to come up
                                                                    with and easy solution).


Packing time:
    unload time 20 sec
    prep time 30 sec
    packing time 60 sec (this is a constraint. If the cobot gets a new batch and returns in less than 60 sec, it must wait. This
                            contraint needs to be considered when choosing the next batch for the cobot.)



2. choose from that matrix the batch that has the least time per order (or time per item) (IMPORTANT: try different choices)
    -- need method to determine the time it takes for the cobot to pick all items and return to packing station (should include waytime as well as waiting time for pickers)
    -- METHOD: batchDuration()
    -- METHOD: batchTimePerOrder() <-- used to chose the "best" batch at the time
    
3. assign the chosen batch to the packing station
    --


4. reduce the set of open orders by the orders of the assigned batch


5. move on to the next packing station and assign another feasible batch


6. after all packing stations are working, wait until any(the first) cobot comes back.
7. send it out again with the algorithm from 1-5 (calculate possible batches, assign batch based on rules, reduce set of open order)



optimizations:
we don't want to send out the robot again for a picking tour, 
that is faster than the packing time of the packer for the previously delivered order. (or add in waiting time)

Calculate distance/time per Batch

1. Total Batch Time
total_time = 0
items in batch
current_location_robot


while items in batch not 0:
    closest_distance_to_next_item = xx
    if current_location_shelf is in the same zone as next item shelf:
      total_time += distance/1.3 #human picker walking speed
      total_time += 3 #add human picking time per item
    else:
      total_time += distance/2.0 #robot
      total_time += 3 #add human picking time per item


    update current_location_robot
    update items in batch (delete ones already picked up)



total_distance = total_distance +  distance_robot_packing_station
return total_distance    #distance of entire batch



Note for Paper:
- Assumption 3 (2 cobots waiting) is optional if we have more time lol
- For optimal route we chose a greedy traveling salesman problem where we always choose the next closest path (Item)

New (13.08.) Greedy Heuristic

1. Assign orders to stations
- Assign first order randomly to a Packing station
- Assign output station with smallest total weight next order


2. Assign orders to batches of cobots
- batch up the orders based on weight constraint
- 1 cobot for 1 packing station

3. Determine the sequencing of visiting pods for each cobot within a route
